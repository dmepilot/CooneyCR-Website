                <p> Cathy brings more than 20 years’ experience in hospitality from direct restaurant management to training and recruiting. A true ‘lifetime restaurateur,’ she grew up in the business as her parents owned multiple restaurant concepts – from fine dining to a successful sports bar - in Breckenridge, Colorado. 
Cathy went on to earn her bachelor’s degree in Hotel & Restaurant Management from the University of Denver and was recruited right out of college by The Palm. With this legendary brand, she grew her career for over 20 years on the management teams of high-profile restaurants in multiple cities including Boston, Dallas and London. In 2007, the opportunity to take over The Palm’s location in her home city of Denver arose, and she returned to lead the iconic restaurant for over 12 years. 
Cathy then moved to serving as General Manager of The One Group’s STK Restaurant in Denver, Cathy increased sales and quickly became the training store for the company, where she trained all new managers from around the country. 
Most recently Cathy went into recruiting with TaletServed.  She learned to Identifying the right leaders for critical openings is an art form, and lucky for their clients, it’s one that TalentServed has learned to do well. Cathy learned engage the latest recruiting technologies and proven methodologies to connect the right talent with the right organizations. 
A ‘master networker,’ she knows no strangers in the Denver market and surrounding major metropolitan areas. In July Cathy started Cooney Consulting & Recruiting.  She currently serves on the Boards of the Department of Public Health and Environment for the City of Denver, as well as the Colorado Restaurant Association Board and served 4 years as the President for the CRA’s Mile High Chapter.
